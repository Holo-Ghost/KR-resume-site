        <h2>Favorite games</h2>
        <p>I am a fan of Fantasy RPGs as well as horror games. I am particularly interested in horror games
            that were created during the PSX and PS2 eras. Since it is so difficult and/or expensive to obtain official copies
            of these games, I often emulate them on my PC.
        </p>

        <p>My Top 5 Games of all time would be:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</li>
            <li>Silent Hill 2</li>
            <li>Bioshock</li>
            <li>Silent Hill 3</li>
            <li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</li>
        </ol>
